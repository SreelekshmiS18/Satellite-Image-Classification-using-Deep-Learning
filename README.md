# 🛰️ Satellite Image Classification using Deep Learning  

## 🌍 Overview  
Earth observation is crucial for monitoring **climate change, urban expansion, deforestation, and water resources**. This project builds a **Deep Learning model** to classify satellite images into different categories like **clouds, deserts, green areas, and water bodies**. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this system can help in **land-use monitoring, environmental research, and disaster management**.  

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of **four major land types**, categorized into:  
✅ **Cloudy** – Images containing cloud cover.  
🏜 **Desert** – Images of barren land and arid regions.  
🌳 **Green Areas** – Regions covered with forests, grasslands, or crops.  
🌊 **Water Bodies** – Rivers, lakes, and ocean regions.  
🔹 The images were collected from **open-source repositories** and preprocessed for uniformity in size and quality.  

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools  
🚀 **Programming Language**: Python  
🖥 **Frameworks & Libraries**:  
   - **Data Processing**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `glob`  
   - **Image Handling**: `skimage`, `OpenCV`  
   - **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
   - **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn`  
   - **Deep Learning**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`  

## 🔍 Approach  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Loaded images from directories using `glob`.  
   - Resized images for consistency.  
   - Normalized pixel values for efficient training.  
   - Shuffled dataset for unbiased learning.  

2️⃣ **Model Architecture**  
   - Implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using `TensorFlow Keras`.  
   - **Feature extraction layers** (Conv2D, MaxPooling).  
   - **Flatten and Dense layers** for classification.  
   - Applied **Softmax activation** for multi-class classification.  

3️⃣ **Training & Evaluation**  
   - Split dataset into **training & testing sets**.  
   - Used **categorical cross-entropy loss** for multi-class classification.  
   - Evaluated performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix**.  

## 📊 Results  
💡 **High classification accuracy** achieved on unseen images!  
📌 The model successfully differentiates between **various land types** with strong generalization capabilities.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements & Real-World Applications  
🔸 **Real-Time Environmental Monitoring** – Deploy AI for live satellite image analysis.  
🔸 **Disaster Prediction** – Identify flood-prone areas and detect wildfires.  
🔸 **Urban Expansion Tracking** – Monitor land-use changes over time.  
🔸 **Edge AI for IoT Devices** – Optimize the model for **drones and satellites**.  
🔸 **Enhanced Classification** – Improve accuracy using **Transfer Learning (ResNet, VGG)**.
